# Simple Task List Application using Python and Flask

This is a simple task list application built using Python and Flask. It allows users to create multiple task lists with different names and manage tasks for each of them. Could be used as TODO list or for tracing items. Currently, there's no authentication added, and the frontend is very basic.

## Features

- **Multiple Task Lists**: Users can create multiple task lists with different names.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, delete tasks within each task list.
- **Basic Frontend**: The frontend is minimalistic and serves the purpose of demonstrating the functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    <!-- ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matibbb232/flask-task-list-app.git
    ``` -->

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```sh
    python3 app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
